# Electronics

This repository contains all the files for the design of all the electronics subsystems of the project.

# Repository's Structure

The repository is structured in two main folders of similar arrangement:

- `Test Stand`
  - `\Hardware`
  - `\Software`
  - `\Documents`
  
- `Avionic` 
  - `\Hardware`
  - `\Software`
  - `\Documents`
  
## Hardware

The Hardware folder contains all the project files dedicated to the design of the corrisponding PCB. The Project files are build using the free software [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/). Once you have an account on the site, import the project file with the `.json` extension that can be found in the directory path:


- `Avionics\Hardware`

This folder also contains the previous version of the board in:
- `Test Stand\Hardware\Test Stand PCB\OldVersion\OldVersionOnKiCad\Test Stand PCB.pro`

## Software

The software folder contains all the files used to develop the corrisponing subsystem's software.
The files are built using [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).

## Documents

The Documents folder contains all the files and datasheet that have been used to develop all the systems.
